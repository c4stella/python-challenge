Assignment 3 of UCI's Data Visualization Program
This repository contains two folders that have:

 - A python script
 - A 'Resources' folder
 - An 'analysis' folder

Please, make sure to download all of these elements.

## PyBank
PyBank will read through a csv file with changes in value of a bank account, and the month that the change occurred.
It will then calculate:

 - The total overall value at the end of the period
 - The total months in the period
 - The average of all changes in profit/losses
 - The greatest increase and decrease of value of the account, and the month this change happened

## PyPoll
PyPoll will read through a csv file with poll data detailing the voter ID, the candidate they voted for, and the county in which they voted in.
It will then calculate:

 - The total number of votes cast
 - A list of all candidates who received votes
 - The percentage of votes each candidate won
 - The total number of votes each candidate won
 - The winner of the election by popular vote

Both of these scripts will print their respective results to a .txt file, and write that file to the 'analysis' folder.
